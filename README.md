# Neko.js
Port of [NekoBot](https://github.com/Kusoneko/Nekobot) by [Kusoneko](https://github.com/Kusoneko), using [discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js) by [hydrabolt](https://github.com/hydrabolt).
Version: 0.0.1

### Installation
Installing the bot is simple, just `npm install` to install the dependancies. That's it.

### Configuration
You'll find a `config.json` file in the project root. Inside that file are all the expected configs: Email, Password, Servers, etc.
The only thing worth noting here is the `server` value is the string of characters at the end of an invite link. For example, to use the bot in https://discord.gg/0Lv5NLFEoz3P07Aq the `server` value would be `0Lv5NLFEoz3P07Aq`.
